# RESTful RFR
This project aims to provide a centralized platform for accessing key information about the Tunis Rapid Rail Network (RFR). It offers static data such as train schedules, station locations, and route connections, helping commuters navigate the system with ease. The backend is designed with security and scalability in mind, incorporating secure password storage, JWT-based authentication for admins, and rate-limiting to protect the system from abuse. The goal is to improve the accessibility and usability of the RFR system, ensuring a better commuting experience for passengers and easy management for admins.
